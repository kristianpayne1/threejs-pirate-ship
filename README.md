Using GPU computation and custom shaders, a semi-realistic simulation of a ship floating on the sea. With a couple of interactions, such as firing the cannon and spinning the wheel. 

Ship, cannon, anchor and wheel models purchased from the [Synty store](https://syntystore.com/en-gb) ([EULA License](https://syntystore.com/en-gb/pages/one-time-purchase-licence)). 

Seagulls modelled and animated by yours truly.
