Made with:

-   [React](https://react.dev/)
-   [ThreeJS](https://threejs.org/)
-   [React Three Fiber](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/getting-started/introduction)
-   [React Three Drei](https://github.com/pmndrs/drei)
-   [GL noise](https://farazzshaikh.github.io/glNoise/module-Common.html)
-   [Three custom shader material](https://github.com/FarazzShaikh/THREE-CustomShaderMaterial#readme)

Models were made within blender and then baked. This gives the scene "realistic" lighting and shadows with no extra processing power. Water is made using custom shaders in order to give it wave motion.
